# Preamble
During a boozy, spring afternoon BBQ in Balham, South London in 2009 I found myself scribbling a design for an Android Widget of sorts that could help me get access to swell data from NOAA buoy _62303_ aka. _Pembroke Buoy_. Pembroke Buoy was ground zero for all nearshore swell predictions for Gower - if Pembroke was showing 2 meters plus and a period >= 6s then you had a good chance of 2ft mediocre surf turning up around Langland... more if you knew where to look further down Gower.

Apps back then were quite terrible. Mostly wrappers around `WebViews` in the leisure space with even the defacto swell forecasting site (MagicSeaweed) imposing an slow, error-prone Cordova offering that simply didn't work most of the time.

So, as I sat there scribbling, I concluded - I could do a better job than the existing solutions and set off building my own Android app (with no commercial agenda) specifically with the task of getting me those Pembroke Buoy numbers the fastest way possible - OceanLife was born.

# The Early Years
- Eclair, Gingerbread & the Fragment revolution!
- The dominant approaches to Android dev back then

# Bringing it to Work
- discussing how most of the architectural changes I was making to my work apps I first trialled in OceanLife
- discussing the testing approach changes I bought over from OceanLife
- discussing the modularisation approaches I bought over from OceanLife
- de-risking knowledge through learning node.js and avoiding Career mobile

# Retrofitting learnings
- Coinciding with my movement away from Android day-to-day was a rapid and unrelenting rise in platform evolutions with Jetpack.
- Doing talks on Android and related

# What next?
- an inevitable decline? The Play Store ratchet.

# A timeline
- Visualisation of key events
